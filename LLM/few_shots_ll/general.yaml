      Q:
        role: 'user'
        content: |
          Can you describe your framework?
      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The framework is composed of many parts:
            - The list of available high-level actions, which are provided within the `actions` keyword;
            - The list of available APIs to call low-level actions, which are provided within the `API` keyword;
            - The list of available mappings, which are provided within the `mappings` keyword; A mapping takes a high-level action and divides it into a set of low-level actions. 
            - A knowledge base describing general information, which is provided within the `KB` keyword;
            - A knowledge base describing the initial state, which is provided within the `init` keyword;
            - A knowledge base describing the goal state, which is provided within the `goal` keyword.

          If the asked question requires just a snippet of code, then you are free to answer as you please. 
          In any other circumstance, you'll have to include the following sections:
          
          ```actions
          ```

          ```KB
          ```

          ```init
          ```

          ```goal
          ```

          ```mappings
          ```

          Any or all of them may be empty, but still every section must be present.

          How do you describe the structure of an action?

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          In our knowledge base, every action is splitted into 'start' and 'end' actions for both durative and instantaneous actions.
          Our knowledge base is composed of predicates to describe the states, and Prolog rules that describe the actions leveraging the following structure:
          ```prolog
          action(
            Name(Argument1, Argument2, ...), 
            ValidConditions, 
            InvalidConditions, 
            InvalidConditionsAtEnd, 
            ConditionsOnKB, 
            Effects
          )
          ```
          The variable Name defines the name of the action and its argument, e.g., for the action corresponding to the gripping of an agent on a block, we use Name=grip(Agent,Block).
          The five variables that follow are lists of conditions that must be checked before deciding whether to add the action or not:                     
          - `ValidConditions` is a list containing conditions that should be verified in the current state;
          - `InvalidConditions` is a list containing conditions that must not be verified in the current state;
          - `ValidConditionsAtEnd` is a list containing conditions that must not be verified in the goal;
          - `ConditionOnKB` is a list containing conditions that must be verified on the knowledge base before deciding on the action.
          - `Effects` is a list containing a list of predicates on how to modify the current state in a new state. Each predicate is in the form of either add(P(...)), which adds P(...) to the state, or del(P(...)), which looks for P(...) in the current state and removes it.

          The list ValidConditionsAtEnd checks if a condition from the goal has already been achieved and avoids actions which may make one of the contained conditions not to hold.
          ConditionOnKB is a list used to force the Prolog interpreter to ground the variables of the action to some values.

          For example, in the knowledge base there may be predicates describing the possible positions in which blocks may be placed: 
          - `pos(1,2)` indicates the position at coordinates (1,2);
          - `pos(0,0)` indicates the position at coordinates (0,0).

      Q:
        role: 'user'

          Given a high-level action, how do you divide it into low-level actions?

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          First of all, since we are talking about temporal planning, the actions have durations and we are going to 
          create macro-actions only for starting high-level actions, meaning that a high-level action can be split into
          many low-level actions only after it has started and it must end after all low-level actions have finished.
          The general structure of a high-level action to low-level actions is the following Prolog predicate:
          ```mappings
          mapping(high_level_actions(args),
            [
              low_level_action_1_start(args_ll_a1_s), 
              low_level_action_1_end(args_ll_a1_e), 
              low_level_action_2_start(args_ll_a2_e), 
              low_level_action_3_start(args_ll_a3_e), 
              low_level_action_3_end(args_ll_a2_e), 
              low_level_action_2_end(args_ll_a3_e), 
              ...
            ]
          )
          ```

          Can you describe your framework?
      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The framework is composed of many parts:
            - The list of available high-level actions, which are provided within the `actions` keyword;
            - The list of available APIs to call low-level actions, which are provided within the `API` keyword;
            - The list of available mappings, which are provided within the `mappings` keyword; A mapping takes a high-level action and divides it into a set of low-level actions. 
            - A knowledge base describing general information, which is provided within the `KB` keyword;
            - The initial state, which is provided within the `init` keyword;
            - The goal state, which is provided within the `goal` keyword.

          Please, answer with just what you are asked for. If you are asked to produce the general knowledge base, then you should not include the initial state or the goal state, nor actions or mappings.
          If you are asked to produce the initial state, then you should not include the goal state, nor actions or mappings, etc.

          If the asked question requires just a snippet of code, then you are free to answer as you please. 
          In any other circumstance, you'll have to include the following sections:
          
          ```actions
          ```

          ```KB
          ```

          ```init
          ```

          ```goal
          ```

          ```mappings
          ```

          Any or all of them may be empty, but still every section must be present.

          How is your code divided?

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The low-level knowledge base is composed of 4 parts:
          - `init` section, which contains the initial state of the environment;
          - `goal` section, which contains the final state of the environment;
          - `KB` section, which contains all the information that is not modified by the actions;
          - `actions` section, which contains the description of the actions that can be performed 
             by the agents.

          For example, the predicate `ll_arm_at(A)`, which states the position of the arm A, is 
          a predicate that is modified by the actions and should be placed in the `init` section.
          On the other hand, the predicate `ll_arm(A)`, which states that the agent A is an arm, is
          a predicate that is not modified by the actions and should be placed in the `KB` section.

          What are the syntactic differences between high-level and low-level predicates?

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The low-level predicates must be prefixed with `ll_`. For example, `agent(A)` tells us
          that A is an agent that can carry out actions, but `ll_arm(A)` specify the role played by 
          A saying that it is a robotic arm.

          What information should be placed in the `KB`? 

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          In the `KB` section, one should place all those pieces of information that are important 
          for the execution of the actions, yet they are not modified by the same actions. 
          For example, one could place the available positions inside the knowledge base so that the
          planner knows which are the positions that can be used, but at the same time it uses other 
          predicates to state whether they are free or being used. 
          ```KB
          :-discontiguous ll_arm/1.
          :-discontiguous ll_wheeled/1.
          ll_arm(a2).
          ll_arm(a3).
          ll_wheeled(a1).
          ll_wheeled(a3).
          ```
          In this knowledge base, we are saying that there two agents that have wheels and two 
          agents that have a robotic arm. `a3` as both wheels and a robotic arm.

          How are the initial and final state written?
      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The initial and final states should contain all those predicates that are used to describe 
          the state of the environment and of the agents at the beginning and at the end. It must 
          not contain predicates that state general information regarding the environment, such as 
          abilities of the agents, positions on the map, total number of appliances, etc.
          For example, the following initial state and knowledge base are correct as the former
          contains predicates describing information destined to change and the latter contains 
          predicates describing a static knowledge base.

          ```init
          init_state([
            ll_arm_at(a1, 1, 2), ll_arm_at(a3 2, 3), ll_car_at(a3, 1, 2), ll_car_at(a2, 5, 5)
          ]).
          ```

          ```KB
          :-discontiguous ll_arm/1.
          :-discontiguous ll_wheeled/1.
          ll_arm(a2).
          ll_arm(a3).
          ll_wheeled(a1).
          ll_wheeled(a3).
          ```

          Though the following initial state and knowledge base are not correct:  

          ```init
          init_state([
            ll_arm_at(a1, 1, 2), ll_arm_at(a3 2, 3), ll_car_at(a3, 1, 2), ll_car_at(a2, 5, 5), 
            ll_wheeled(a1), ll_wheeled(a3)
          ]).
          ```

          ```KB
          :-discontiguous ll_arm/1.
          ll_arm(a2).
          ll_arm(a3).
          ```

          As the information regarding the available positions should be stated in the `KB` section 
          since the positions remain the same in time.

          What is considered to be a resource?
      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          The resources are supplies that the planner can use in order to achieve the goal. For 
          instance, arms are considered resources, as they can be used to perform actions and the 
          planner can assign them.

      Q:

          How do you describe the structure of an action?

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          In our knowledge base, every action is splitted into 'start' and 'end' actions for both durative and instantaneous actions.
          Our knowledge base is composed of predicates to describe the states, and Prolog rules that describe the actions leveraging the following structure:
          ```prolog
          action(
            Name(Argument1, Argument2, ...), 
            ValidConditions, 
            InvalidConditions, 
            InvalidConditionsAtEnd, 
            ConditionsOnKB, 
            Effects
          )
          ```
          The variable Name defines the name of the action and its argument, e.g., for the action corresponding to the gripping of an agent on a block, we use Name=grip(Agent,Block).
          The five variables that follow are lists of conditions that must be checked before deciding whether to add the action or not:                     
          - `ValidConditions` is a list containing conditions that should be verified in the current state;
          - `InvalidConditions` is a list containing conditions that must not be verified in the current state;
          - `ValidConditionsAtEnd` is a list containing conditions that must not be verified in the goal;
          - `ConditionOnKB` is a list containing conditions that must be verified on the knowledge base before deciding on the action.
          - `Effects` is a list containing a list of predicates on how to modify the current state in a new state. Each predicate is in the form of either add(P(...)), which adds P(...) to the state, or del(P(...)), which looks for P(...) in the current state and removes it.

          The list ValidConditionsAtEnd checks if a condition from the goal has already been achieved and avoids actions which may make one of the contained conditions not to hold.
          ConditionOnKB is a list used to force the Prolog interpreter to ground the variables of the action to some values.

      Q:
        role: 'user'
        content: |
          Given a high-level action, how do you divide it into low-level actions, i.e., how do you 
          find a mapping for the high-level action? 

      A:
        role: 'assistant'
        content: |
          First of all, since we are talking about temporal planning, the actions have durations and we are going to 
          create macro-actions only for starting high-level actions, meaning that a high-level action can be split into
          many low-level actions only after it has started and it must end after all low-level actions have finished.
          The general structure of a high-level action to low-level actions is the following Prolog predicate:
          ```
          mapping(high_level_actions(args),
            [
              low_level_action_1_start(args_ll_a1_s), 
              low_level_action_1_end(args_ll_a1_e), 
              low_level_action_2_start(args_ll_a2_e), 
              low_level_action_3_start(args_ll_a3_e), 
              low_level_action_3_end(args_ll_a2_e), 
              low_level_action_2_end(args_ll_a3_e), 
              ...
            ]
          ).
          ```
